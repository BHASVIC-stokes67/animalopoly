# Animalopoly
In this repository you will find three resources that you need to complete the Animalopoly project.

**This is also where all of your code will live** - at first this will just be the classes that you are responsible for but by the end of the project there should be a copy of your group's finished code in your own repository.

## Resources
### Animalopoly Template
This is where the write up of your project **must** go - you will be required to commit and push changes to this at least once a week but this document should be open throughout all stage of the project and should be updated constantly.
There are checklist, explanations and a very basic guide on how to use Word's built in referencing tool to ensure that you are able to correctly cite the sources you have used throughout your project.

### Animalopoly LessonPPT
This is the PowerPoint that we used in the first lesson, saved here for ease of reference.

### OOP Animal Board Game
This is the task sheet that contains details of what you need to create.
