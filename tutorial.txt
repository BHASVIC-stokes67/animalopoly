HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
You are one of up to 4 players
You begin with no animals and £3750 on the start square
You may choose a symbol to represent your position on the board
At the beginning of your turn, you roll 2 dice and move one space across the board that many times
If you rolled the same number on both dice, you draw 1 card from the deck and immediately use it
The effects of the cards vary between gaining or losing money, or winning the lottery
When you land on an animal not owned by anyone, you may buy the animal for its cost
When you land on an animal owned by another player, you must pay the rent cost on the animal to that player
When another player lands on one of your animals, they must pay the rent cost to you
Once you own the animal, you may pay additional costs in order to make the rent on that animal more expensive
The board holds 24 animals on different spaces, a start square, and a miss a go square
When you land on the miss a go square, you miss the rest of your turn and your next turn
When you pass the start square, you gain £500. If you landed on that square, instead you get £1000
If you run out of money, you die
If you are the last person alive, you win the game
